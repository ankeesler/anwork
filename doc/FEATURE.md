# ANWORK FEATURE REQUESTS

This document contains feature requests for the ANWORK project. The feature requests are divided up
into sections below.

## Application
- Add the ability for a Task to have a category and display that category on the screen.
- Add the ability to generate a report for what you did the last N days (look at all
  finished tasks, tell how long they took).

## CLI
- Add support for CliArgumentType.FILE.
- Add examples into the CLI schema (an example should have "text" and a "description" of what the
  example actually does).
- The CLI argument outputs look terrible. Let's fix these.

## Infrastructure
- Can we mandate that protocol buffer classes are named accordingly?
- We need to clear the context between smoketest methods because there are leftover journal entries!

## Journaling

## Persistence

## Serialization
- We need a more defined way to get a class' Serializer.
