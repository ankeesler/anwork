TODO
----
- The serialization system should support escaping certain characters.
- The #serializer methods should be #getSerializer so that the methods start with
  a verb.
- The Google checkstyle needs to be adopted.
- The CLI usage printing is ugly. Write a real test for this.
- Create a framework where a CLI can be supplied by an XML file and turned into
  source creation of CLI, tests, and documentation.
